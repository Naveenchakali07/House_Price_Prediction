# üè° House Price Prediction 

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, location, area, and other property-related attributes. The goal is to analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance to provide reliable price predictions for real estate stakeholders.

##  Objectives

* Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing on the housing dataset
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, outliers, and feature relationships
* Engineer relevant features to improve model performance
* Apply multiple machine learning algorithms for price prediction
* Compare models using appropriate regression metrics (R¬≤, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
* Implement cross-validation for robust model evaluation
* Visualize results for better interpretability and stakeholder communication
